Basically it's says that having scripting language to expose internals of the
application rather than an eclipse style API which requires a lot of overhead
such as xml config stuff and learning a complex API. Where as a scripting
language is easy to make a small script that does something useful for the
application.

So the idea could be to extend to and expose some of the internals using
python. This way we have a full language and we can implement things on top of
tor using python..

RAPTOP: Routing Attacks on Privacy in Tor.
BGP - Border Gateway Protocol.
AS - Autonomous Systems
Asymmetric Traffic Analysis and BGP Churn:
- Raptor asymmetric traffic analysis attacks can deanonymize a user with a 95%
accuracy with no false positives.
- As long as the adversary is able to observe any direction of the traffic
  (i.e. forward only, backward only or both), they can deanonymise users.
- This attack is a more adavanced version of the conventional end-to-end timing
  anaysis attack, but instead of requiring to observe both forward and backward
communications, they only require one direction. They still need to observe at
both ends i.e. client to entry and exit to server.
Natural Churn:
- Internet paths between clients and guard relays change over time due to
  physical changes in topology, for example failures, recoveries and
introduction of thew routers and links as well as AS-level routing policies.
- These changes can increase the power of AS surveileance. For example Figure 2
  from paper.
BGP Hijack:
- AS-level adversaries are capable of launching active attacks
- Can deviate from honest routing behaviour
- Can manipulate inter-domain routing by advertising incorrect BGP control
  messages
- can hijack an IP prefix by adversiting the prefix as its own. The attack
  causes a fraction of Internet traffic destined to teh prefix to be captured
by the adversary
- This increases the chance of an AS-level adversary to be able to observe
  traffic between clients and entry guards and servers and exit relays.
- The traffic is silently dropped without telling the source that the data did
  not reach the recipient. Resulting in the connection being dropped.
BGP Interceptions:
- They found that 90% of Tor relays are vulnerable to interception attacks.
  They also demonstrated the feasibility of the attack.
- Allows malicious AS to become an intermediate AS in the path towards the
  guard relay, i.e. after interception the traffic is routed bac to the actual
guard relay.
- This attack allows the connection to stay alive.
- Allowing malicious AS to deanonymize the client via asymmetric traffic
  analysis.
- They demontrate this attack against a live Tor relay.
Countermeasures:
- They desigs a monitoring framework for the Tor network tthat aims to detect
suspicious AS-level changes toward Tor prefixes using both BGP and Traceroute
monitoring.
- AS-Aware Path Selection:
	- To minimize opportunities for AS-level traffic analysis
	- Tor network can monitor path dynamics between clients and guards, and
	  exit relays and destinations
	- each relay could publish the list of any ASes it used to reach each
	  destination prefix in the last month
	- This info can be distributed to all Tor clients
	- Tor clients can use this information for relay selection
	- They could select relays such that the same AS does not appear in
	  both the first and the last segments of the IP address
- Preventing Routing Attacks in Tor:
	- Adversiting /24 Tor prefixes:
		- Over 90% of Tor relays have a prefix length sorter than /24
		- This is vulnerable to AS-level BGP hijack or interception attack
		- AS's typically filter route advertisements of prefix longer than /24
		- so adversaries will no be able to launch a more specific hijack or
	  interception attack
	- Favouring closer guard relays:
		- Even if a Tor relay advertises a /24 prefix, an adversary can
		  launch a specific prefix hijack interception attack
		- in this case the impact of the attack is localized around the
		  attackers AS since the route is not globally propagated
		- Tor clients should their guard relays by with a shorter
		  AS-level path between them.
		- Ths mitigates the risk to Tor clients due to an specific
		  prefix attack
		- Also reduces the risk of asymmetric traffic analysis and BGP
		  churn
