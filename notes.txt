Basically it's says that having scripting language to expose internals of the
application rather than an eclipse style API which requires a lot of overhead
such as xml config stuff and learning a complex API. Where as a scripting
language is easy to make a small script that does something useful for the
application.

So the idea could be to extend to and expose some of the internals using
python. This way we have a full language and we can implement things on top of
tor using python..
