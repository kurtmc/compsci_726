Jenna's paper: Methods for identifying clients who communicate with specific servers using TCP and on Tor. By only watching the client, not both. And some countermeasures for this.

Kurt's paper: Classifies traffic into three categories: streaming, bit torrent and browsing. Uses machine learning to do this and gives higher priority to browsing.

#Instructions:
Come up with novel research ideas.
IEEE double column format (A4).

Tor is not purely anonymizing. Exploits that reduce anonymity.
