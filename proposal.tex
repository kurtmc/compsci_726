Tor provides anonymity by routing communications within layers of
encryption. A vulnerability in the Tor network is the indirect rate
reduction attack. This attack can reduce anonymity by monitoring client
connections and spoofing traffic on Tor exit relay. By spoofing messages
to an exit relay at a rate slower than the client was previously
receiving messages, a rate reduction can be observed. This indicates that
the client is likely to be communicating with that specific server. We
propose a method to counteract this attack by extending Tor to mask the
rate of messages being received.

Ideas

Sending random packets from entry relay to client

pros:
- adds noise to rate
- hard as fuck to figure out

cons:
- reduce tor performance


limit rate:

pros:

- rate consistant, so hard to figure out

cons:
- performance loss
- figure out-able
